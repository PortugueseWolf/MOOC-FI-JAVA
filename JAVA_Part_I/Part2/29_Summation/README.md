# Summation

Expand the method sum in the exercise template so that it calculates and returns the sum of the numbers that are given as the parameters.

```java
public static int sum(int number1, int number2, int number3, int number4) {
    // write your code here
    // remember to include return (at the end)!
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    int answer = sum(4, 3, 6, 1);
    System.out.println("Sum: " + answer);
}
```
