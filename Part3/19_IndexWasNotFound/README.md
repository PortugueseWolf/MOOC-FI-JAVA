# Index was not found

The exercise template already has an array containing numbers. Complete the program so that it asks the user for a number to search in the array. If the array contains the given number, the program tells the index containing the number. If the array doesn't contain the given number, the program will advise that the number wasn't found.

```java
Search for? 3
3 is at index 4.
```

```java
Search for? 22
22 was not found.
```
