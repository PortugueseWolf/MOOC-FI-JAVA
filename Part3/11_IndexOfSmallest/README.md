# Index of smallest

Write a program that reads numbers from the user. When number 9999 is entered, the reading process stops. After this the program will print the smallest number in the list, and also the indices where that number is found. Notice: the smallest number can appear multiple times in the list.

```java
72
44
8
8
11
9999

Smallest number: 8
Found at index: 2
Found at index: 3
```
