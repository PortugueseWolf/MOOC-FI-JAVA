# MOOC FI JAVA

A repo of my answers to the [MOOC FI JAVA](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/)

This is a work in progress and the answers won't be pretty or the best or optimized

I'm also using this oportunity to learn how to use Git and GitHub

## Note

When copying the Java files from the repo to TMC the package attribute needs to be deleted or changed so it coincides with TMC.

## Environment

My current setup at this date (2023-09-16)

- W11 Home Beta Channel
- VS Code Insiders with Test My Code extension
- Eclipse Temurin JDK with Hotspot 17.0.8+7 (x64)

## Why?

This is kind of a personal log, since in each exercise I'll include my notes and toughts

## Contributions

If you see anything just plain wrong, feel free to let me know
