# Dinosaur

Same as the previous exercise but emphasizes the use of the "sout" shorthand

Typing just "sout" on the IDE then using the tab key will output `System.out.println();`

## Exercise

Print using "sout" shorthand: "Once upon a time there was a dinosaur" in three seperate lines

## Expressions used

Print: `System.out.println();`
