# Vocabulary practice

In this exercise you are going to create the previously described application to practise new vocabulary. The application should start when the main method of the VocabularyPracticeApplication is executed.

Follow the previous example and create an application for practising translations. The application should offer two views. In the first view the user can enter words and their translations into the program. In the second view the user is asked to translate different words. The words to be translated should be randomly selected from among all the words that have been entered into the program.

Let's discuss the user interface in more detail. The button that shows the input view should contain the text "Enter new words". The button that shows the practice view should contain the text "Practice". In the input view, the first text field should have the word in the original language, and the second text field should contain the translation of that word. The button that adds this word and the translation should read "Add the word pair". In the practice view the user is presented with a word in the original language, and their task is to write down the translation. If the answer is correct, the user interface displays the text "Correct!". If the answer is incorrect, the text that is displayed is "Incorrect!". In this case the correct translation is also shown.

There are no automatic tests in this project â€” return your solution when the program works in the way described above. The model solution contains an initial sketch of a possible solution to create statistics. This is not essential for the purposes of this exercise, so there is no need to find these elements in your answer.
