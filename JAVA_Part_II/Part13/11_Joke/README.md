# Joke

Use the class JokeApplication that is provided with the exercise template to create a program that explains a joke. The application offers a menu consisting of three buttons, and the contents that can be changed by clicking on these buttons. The first button (containing the text "Joke") shows a question that is related to a joke. The second button (text "Answer") show the related answer. The third and the final button ("Explanation") brings up the explanation for the joke.

By default (when it starts) the program should show a joke-related question. Use the following string as the question: "What do you call a bear with no teeth?". The answer should be "A gummy bear." You can come up with a suitable explanation by yourself.
