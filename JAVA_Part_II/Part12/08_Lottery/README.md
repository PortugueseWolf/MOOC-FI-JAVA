# Lottery

Your assignment is to complete the class LotteryRow, which is used to draw the week's winning numbers. The numbers are in range 1—40, and 7 numbers will be drawn in total. In other words, a lottery row consists of seven different numbers that are all in range 1—40.

We wish to implement the following functions in the class:

- the constructor LotteryRow creates a new LotteryRow object that contains new randomized numbers.
- the method numbers returns the drawn lottery numbers of this lottery row
- the method containsNumber tells whether the given number is included in the drawn numbers
- the method randomizeNumbers randomizes new numbers for the lottery row.
The basic structure of the class is as follows:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Random;

    public class LotteryRow {
    private ArrayList<Integer> numbers;

    public LotteryRow() {
        this.randomizeNumbers();
    }

    public ArrayList<Integer> numbers() {
        return this.numbers;
    }

    public boolean containsNumber(int number) {
        // Tests whether the number is already among the randomized numbers
        return false;
    }

    public void randomizeNumbers() {
        // initialize the list for numbers
        this.numbers = new ArrayList<>();
        // Implement the randomization of the numbers by using the method containsNumber() here
    }

    public boolean equals(Object other) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

The following main program is supplied in the exercise base:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LotteryRow row = new LotteryRow();
        ArrayList<Integer> lotteryNumbers = row.numbers();

        System.out.println("Lottery numbers:");
        for (int number: lotteryNumbers) {
            System.out.print(number + " ");
        }

        System.out.println("");
    }
}
```

Here are a few possible outputs of the program:

```markdown
Lottery numbers:
3 5 10 14 15 27 37
```

```markdown
Lottery numbers:
2 9 11 18 23 32 34
```

**NB!** The same number can only appear once in a lottery row. The numbers don't need to be ordered.
