# Literacy Comparison

This exercise uses open data about literacy levels, provided by UNESCO. The data includes statistics of estimated or reported levels of literacy for various countries for the past two years. File literacy.csv, included with the exercise template, includes the literacy estimates for women and men over 15 years of age. Each line in the file literacy.csv is as follows: "theme, age group, gender, country, year, literacy percent. Below are the first five lines as an example.

Adult literacy rate, population 15+ years, female (%),United Republic of Tanzania,2015,76.08978
Adult literacy rate, population 15+ years, female (%),Zimbabwe,2015,85.28513
Adult literacy rate, population 15+ years, male (%),Honduras,2014,87.39595
Adult literacy rate, population 15+ years, male (%),Honduras,2015,88.32135
Adult literacy rate, population 15+ years, male (%),Angola,2014,82.15105
Create a program that first reads the file literacy.csv and then prints the contents from the lowest to the highest ranked on the literacy rate. The output must be exactly as in the following example. The example shows the first five of the expected rows.

```markdown
Niger (2015), female, 11.01572
Mali (2015), female, 22.19578
Guinea (2015), female, 22.87104
Afghanistan (2015), female, 23.87385
Central African Republic (2015), female, 24.35549
```

This exercise is worth two points.

Tip! Here's how to split a string into an array by each comma.

```java
String string = "Adult literacy rate, population 15+ years, female (%),Zimbabwe,2015,85.28513";
String[] pieces = string.split(",");
// now pieces[0] equals "Adult literacy rate"
// pieces[1] equals " population 15+ years"
// etc.

// to remove whitespace, use the trim() method:
pieces[1] = pieces[1].trim();
```
