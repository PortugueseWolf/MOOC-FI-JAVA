# Sort them cards!

The exercise template has a class that represents a playing card. Each card has a value and a suit. A card's value is represented as a number 2, 3, ..., 14 and its suit as Club, Diamond, Heart or Spade. Ace's value is 14. The value is represented with an integer, and the suit as an enum. Cards also have a method toString, which can be used to print the value and the suit in a readable form.

New cards can be created like this:

```java
Card first = new Card(2, Suit.DIAMOND);
Card second = new Card(14, Suit.SPADE);
Card third = new Card(12, Suit.HEART);

System.out.println(first);
System.out.println(second);
System.out.println(third);
```

The output:

```markdown
DIAMOND 2
SPADE A
HEART Q
```

## Part 1 - Comparable Card class

Change the Card class to be Comparable. Implement the compareTo method so that using it sorts the cards in ascending order based on their value. If the cards being compared have the same value, they are sorted by club first, diamond second, heart third, and spade last.

Reading Ordinal method of Enum will help you out in sorting the cards by their suit.
So, for this sorting, the least valuable card is two of clubs and most valuable card is the ace of spades.

## Part 2 - Hand

Create a class Hand to represent the cards in a player's hand. Add the following methods to the class:

- public void add(Card card) adds a card to the hand
- public void print() prints the cards in hand as shown in the example below

```java
Hand hand = new Hand();

hand.add(new Card(2, Suit.DIAMOND));
hand.add(new Card(14, Suit.SPADE));
hand.add(new Card(12, Suit.HEART));
hand.add(new Card(2, Suit.SPADE));

hand.print();
```

Outputs:

```markdown
DIAMOND 2
SPADE A
HEART Q
SPADE 2
```

Use an ArrayList to store the cards.

## Part 3 - Sorting the hand

Add a method public void sort() to the Hand class, which sorts the cards in the hand. After sorting, the cards are printed in order:

```java
Hand hand = new Hand();

hand.add(new Card(2, Suit.DIAMOND));
hand.add(new Card(14, Suit.SPADE));
hand.add(new Card(12, Suit.HEART));
hand.add(new Card(2, Suit.SPADE));

hand.sort();

hand.print();
```

Output:

```markdown
DIAMOND 2
SPADE 2
HEART Q
SPADE A
```

## Part 4 - Comparing hands

In a card game, hands are ranked based on the sum of values of its cards. Modify the Hand class to be comparable based on this criteria, i.e. change the class so that interface Comparable<Hand> applies to it.

Here's an example of a program that compares the hands:

```java
Hand hand1 = new Hand();

hand1.add(new Card(2, Suit.DIAMOND));
hand1.add(new Card(14, Suit.SPADE));
hand1.add(new Card(12, Suit.HEART));
hand1.add(new Card(2, Suit.SPADE));

Hand hand2 = new Hand();

hand2.add(new Card(11, Suit.DIAMOND));
hand2.add(new Card(11, Suit.SPADE));
hand2.add(new Card(11, Suit.HEART));

int comparison = hand1.compareTo(hand2);

if (comparison < 0) {
    System.out.println("better hand is");
    hand2.print();
} else if (comparison > 0){
    System.out.println("better hand is");
    hand1.print();
} else {
    System.out.println("hands are equal");
}
```

Output

```markdown
better hand is
DIAMOND J
SPADE J
HEART J
```

## Part 5 - Sorting cards with different criteria

What if we want to sort the cards in different ways, e.g. sorting all the cards of the same suit in a row. A class can only have one compareTo method, so we'll need something else to sort the cards in to a different order.

Alternative sorting systems are possible through different sorting classes. Such a class must have the Comparator<Card> interface. An object of the sorting class will then compare two cards give as parameters. The class only has one method, compare(Card c1, Card c2), which returns a negative value if the card c1 should be sorted before card c2, a positive value if card c2 comes before card c1, and zero if they are equal.

The idea is to create a different sorting class for each different way of sorting the cards, e.g. cards of the same suit in a row.:

```java
import java.util.Comparator;

public class SortBySuit implements Comparator<Card> {
    public int compare(Card c1, Card c2) {
        return c1.getSuit().ordinal() - c2.getSuit().ordinal();
    }
}
```

When sorting the cards by suit, use the same order as with the compareTo method: clubs first, diamonds second, hearts third, spades last.

Sorting still works with the sort method of Collections class. As its other parameter, the method now receives the object that has the sorting logic.

```java
ArrayList<Card> cards = new ArrayList<>();

cards.add(new Card(3, Suit.SPADE));
cards.add(new Card(2, Suit.DIAMOND));
cards.add(new Card(14, Suit.SPADE));
cards.add(new Card(12, Suit.HEART));
cards.add(new Card(2, Suit.SPADE));

SortBySuit sortBySuitSorter = new SortBySuit();
Collections.sort(cards, sortBySuitSorter);

cards.stream().forEach(c -> System.out.println(c));
```

Output:

```markdown
DIAMOND 2
HEART Q
SPADE 3
SPADE A
SPADE 2
```

The sorting object can also be created directly when sort method is called.

```java
Collections.sort(cards, new SortBySuit());
```

It can even be done with a lambda function, without ever creating the sorting class.

```java
Collections.sort(cards, (c1, c2) -> c1.getSuit().ordinal() - c2.getSuit().ordinal());
```

Now, create a class BySuitInValueOrder class that has the Comparator interface, which sorts the cards in the same order as in the above example, except that now the cards are sorted by value inside their suit.

## Part 6 - Sorting the hand by suit

Add a method public void sortBySuit() to class Hand. When the method is called, it sorts the cards in the hand with the same logic as in the previous part. After being sorted, the cards are printed in the following order:

```java
Hand hand = new Hand();

hand.add(new Card(12, Suit.HEART));
hand.add(new Card(4, Suit.SPADE));
hand.add(new Card(2, Suit.DIAMOND));
hand.add(new Card(14, Suit.SPADE));
hand.add(new Card(7, Suit.HEART));
hand.add(new Card(2, Suit.SPADE));

hand.sortBySuit();

hand.print();
```

Output:

```markdown
DIAMOND 2
HEART 7
HEART Q
SPADE 2
SPADE 4
SPADE A
```
